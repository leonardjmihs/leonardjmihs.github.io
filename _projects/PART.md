I was the Autonomy/GNC and Aero design lead for the <a href="https://www.purdueaerial.com/"> Purdue Aerial Robotics Team </a>(PART)! It was one of the funnest clubs I joined while I was an undergrad, and where I developed my interest in robotics. We designed autonomous fixed wing aircraft for the AUVSI SUAS competition; we're talking 6 foot long wingspan, $1000s of dollars flying birds. What started out as band of 8 sophomores/juniors + 1 freshman (me!), in 3 years we grew into a 150+ large team, with sponsorships including Aerovironment, BLue Origin, Raytheon, and NASA, among others. 

Going from simply learning ROS, PX4, XFLR5, to teaching it to the club, I believe PART was the greatest source of learning from my undergrad. If you want to support a great organization (or happen to be an undergrad at Purdue and want to meet some really great folks), definetely check them out!
