## Hello World!
I'm a current PhD Candidate at Northeastern University, where I am lucky enough to be advised by <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/everett-michael/"> Michael Everett </a> in the <a href="https://neu-autonomy.github.io/lab_website/"> NAIL </a> Lab. I generally am interested in 
1. Safe-ifying our current robots, through both neural network verification and control-theoretic tools 
1. Scalable, real-time algorithms for long-term/multi-robot SLAM
1. Fun/cool optimization techniques (especially utilizing structure/geometry) 

I also am drawn to anything with very pretty math (current obsession: Riemannian Optimization)!


Previously, I earned my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Purdue University, where, I among other things, was fortunate enough to work in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/AOL"> Autonomy and Optimization LaB </a> under <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=243160"> Ran Dai </a> working on solving QCQPs for optimal planning and controls and the design of origami-inspired robots.

Feel free to drop me an email; I advise undergrad/masters students regularly, and additionally get nerd-sniped very easily!
